CBC.PDESys
---------

CBC.PDESys is a Python package, built on top of FEniCS, for specifying and
solving large systems of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with
very compact, flexible and reusable code (see, e.g.,
http://fenicsproject.org/featured/2011/pdesys.html). The package is completely
general and targets any system of PDEs. For now we have focused development on
Computational Fluid Dynamics in the subpackage CBC.CFD. The incompressible
Navier-Stokes solvers that are currently implemented can be used for both
laminar and variable viscosity turbulent flows, i.e., the Reynolds Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The fully coupled and segregated NS solvers work
for steady or transient flows, utilizing either Newton or Picard iteration
techniques. Implemented turbulence models are currently the standard k-epsilon,
Spalart Allmaras, V2F or elliptic relaxation models. CBC.PDESys and its
subpackage CBC.CFD are primarily being developed at the Center for Biomedical
Computing at Simula Research Laboratory in Oslo, Norway. CBC.PDESys is
distributed freely in the hope that it will be useful, but without any
warranty.
